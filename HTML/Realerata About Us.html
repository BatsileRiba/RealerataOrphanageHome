        <h2>We are Realerata</h2>
        <p>At Realerata, we believe that every child deserves a safe, nurturing, and loving environment where they can grow and thrive. Our mission is to provide this home for children who have been orphaned, abandoned, or are in need of care.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2005, this has been a home to over 150 loved children and adults. We have removed children from the streets and become one big family. Our children grow up to become respectable people in the community and wherever they go. Discipline is our top priority and we do not make any exceptions when it comes to orphans. We do not partake in any special treatments because we believe that every child is equal, no matter where they come from. We also take in older children up to the age of 21. We believe that everyone deserves a chance to find themselves, together with the support of others alongside them. Tutoring services are available to each and every one of our children, free of charge. Our children go to top universities in South Africa.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to provide a loving home, education, and emotional support to children in need, empowering them to build a brighter future.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>We envision a world where every child is nurtured, valued, and given the opportunity to achieve their full potential.</p>
        <br>
